            <p>A hobby is an activity, interest, or pastime that is undertaken for pleasure or relaxation, done during one's own time. </p>
            <p><b>Here is the List of My Hobbies</b></p>

                   Camping: I really like doing camping.Camping is an outdoor activity involving overnight stays away from home in a shelter, such as a tent or a recreational vehicle.
                  Typically we leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment.
                  To be regarded as "camping" a minimum of one night is spent outdoors, distinguishing it from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities.
                  Camping can be enjoyed through all four seasons. </p> <br> <br> <br>

                  <p><img src="image/reading.jpg" alt="Reading" align="left" style="margin-right:15px;">
                  Reading: For me reading novels is not only my hobby but is for most of my days the moment I wait for as soon as I get up.
                  No matter what I am doing I count the time left till I get to sit back with a novel and enjoy. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

                  <p><img src="image/cooking.jpg" alt="Cooking" align="left" style="margin-right:15px;"">
